<hr>
<p>Wrote myself a letter
Just a single question
"When you finally get this
<em>Where will you be?</em>
Will you be a shipwreck or a star
Falling for a boy who doesn't play guitar?"
Now rewind the tape back to the start
Said I'd never leave you but here we are<br>
And you can't look at me now
I haven't changed, I'm still the same
But you can't look at me now
A hand grenade to throw away<br>
Now my friends all tell me
"Girl, you're getting skinny
Have you not been sleeping?"
<em>How could I be?</em>
Tryna find the light switch in the dark
Burying&nbsp;the good girl I know I'm not
Now rewind the tape back to the start
Said I'd never leave you but here we are
And you can't look at me now
I haven't changed, I'm still the same
<strong>But you can't look at me now</strong>
A hand grenade to throw away<br>
I can't run anymore
Gotta stay right here&nbsp;and face the storm
I can't run anymore
Where the wake up call is all I know
I can't run anymore
Gotta stay right here and face the storm
I can't run anymore<br>
You can't look at me now
I haven't changed, I'm still the same
But you can't look at me now
A hand grenade to throw away
<strong>You can't look at me now</strong></p>
